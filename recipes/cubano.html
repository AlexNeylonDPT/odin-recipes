    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    A Cubano panini is a pressed Cuban sandwich made with layers<br> 
    of ham, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, dill pickles, and mustard<br> 
    on Cuban bread, then grilled until the bread is crispy and the<br>  
    cheese is melted. The sandwich's exact ingredients and preparation<br> 
    can vary by region, but the combination of savory pork, salty ham,<br> 
    tangy pickles, and rich cheese creates a flavorful and popular<br> 
    pressed sandwich originating in Florida</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 loaf Cuban bread</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
      <li>1 lb roast pork</li>
      <li>1 lb sliced ham</li>
      <li>4 ounces Swiss cheese</li>
      <li>4 ounces sliced dill pickles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li> <strong>The Bread:</strong> 
      Slice the loaf of bread in half lengthwise.<br> 
      Butter the top and bottom half with 2 tablespoon softened butter.<br> Spread the mustard on the top piece of bread.</li>
      <li> <strong>Layer It Up:</strong> Layer the sandwich with roast<br> 
      pork, sliced ham, Swiss cheese and pickles. Top the Cubano with<br>   the top bread slice.</li>
      <li> <strong>Butter, Grill and Press:</strong> Slather the remaining butter<br> 
      over both sides of the sandwich. Heat a grill, grill pan or heavy skillet<br> 
      to medium heat. Grill the Cuban sandwich for 5-6 minutes per side,<br> 
      pressing it down very firmly with a cast iron skillet on top or spatula <br> 
      to "press" it tightly, until golden brown and bread is nice and crispy.</li>
